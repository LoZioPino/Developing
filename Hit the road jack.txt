Hey y'all listen
last night
I was out with some the cats in the band
and we were having a good time you know we had this little 
blackjack game going on you what I mean...
A-And I somehow got lucky. 
And-and everytime I try to leave they kept yelling at me...
y-you know... they wanna get their money back, 
so I stayed there 'till I had all of it. 
And you know friend...
I was so excited. 
I just left, and then I just started whistling to myself
[whistling sound] 
ohh man I'm thinking 
when I get home 
my woman gon be so glad to see me 
I know she gon open the door (yeah) 
and she gon open her arms (yeah) 
and I know she gon open....(woah) 
Ah ah ah I was wrong as hell I'll tell you right now. 
She waiting on me alright, right in the middle of the living room floor 
I couldn't believe what was happening the woman went crazy she started yelling and screaming at me talking about...

Old woman, old woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)

Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more

Blue vs Red
